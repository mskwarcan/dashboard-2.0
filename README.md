The Project
===========
This project is a social dashboard that pulls statistical information from the Facebook API, Twitter API, Google Analytics API, and Mail Chimp API and displays it in a nice friendly dashboard. The old branch is what we are currently using internally at work for clients and the master branch is still in development with plans to eventually allow everyone access.

Why I wrote it
--------------
This project started out with me just playing around with some Social Media APIs. After having access to all kinds of information, I asked our Social Media people which statistics our clients cared most about and grabbed all that information and put it in one, easy to read place so that clients could see how their social media campaign was doing at any time and compare it to previous months.

Why I'm proud of it
-------------------
I'm proud of this project because it started with just me playing around with APIs into a application that people find very useful. A lot of the stuff that I create isn't used by very many people, so when I do create something that makes other people's lives easier, it's something I take pride in.
